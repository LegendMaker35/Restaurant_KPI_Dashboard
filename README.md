# Restaurant KPI Dashboard

This project simulates restaurant operations over a 30-day period across multiple store locations. The dashboard is built in **Microsoft Excel** using Pivot Tables, charts, and calculated KPIs. It provides a clear visual breakdown of sales, labor and food costs, customer activity, and revenue patterns to support decision-making in a multi-unit restaurant business.
